# JohnBenedictDiceRollGame
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is the repository of John Benedict Ocampo Divinagracia for the game/program he is building for his Fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming (5N0541). This program aims to replicate the dice roll game in which players roll dice 6 consecutive times to win, with the use of the Java programming language.  It uses For loops, If statements, and JOptionpane.
 
 As per instructtion of the teacher the following documents were added: 
    1) error log
    2) design document
    3) the actual .java application

This project tested students' programming abilities based on their knowledge of (for) foops, If statements and JOptionPane. 

Instructions document for the assesment was also added in the repository
